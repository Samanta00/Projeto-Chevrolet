# Chevrolet

### Purpose and Scope
This project consists of putting into practice all my knowledge acquired in HTML, CSS and Javascript, in which I have been deepening my studies since then. I aim for a good quality code and a clean design in which I can show that I care about even the smallest details.

### What is this project?
The project consists in replicating a Chevrolet dealership website, with a complex layout, maps, contact link, form with field validation, and navigation between pages.
